## Revistiting TM
The rocket is getting much closer to completion, and we were able to run out first system test. We did this by wiring up all sensors to the main computer board and radio card, and placing dummy load attenuators on the antennas (as to not overload the receiver from too much gain). The FM tuner was able to demodulate the signals, pass it through the antenna polarization selector to the bit-synchronizer, and finally onto the computer where the PCM (pulse-code modulation) was decoded and displayed.

Result: All the sensors are go! For this launch we managed to include a pressure sensor, magnetometer, accelerometer, dual temperature sensors in the nose and body, an IR Light sensor, and internal battery voltage. There aslo is a signal that records the launch command so we can get a precise start to our sensor readings.

## Hello NOAA
With a bit of spare time the Telemetry group set up an antenna and a USB SDR (Software Defined Radio) to track NOAA sattelites. We were able to get NOAA-15, 18, and 19. Currently, NOAA is operating five polar orbiters, and Andoya's proximity to the pole means it is in an excellent position to track all of the operational ones on each orbit (as opposed to once-per day for most other places on earth).

The newest, NOAA-19, was launched February 07, 2009. NOAA-19 is classified as the "operational" satellite. NOAA polar sattelites have been launched 

So where are NOAA-16 and 17?
NOAA-17 was decomissioned on 10 April 2013. NOAA-16 was decommissioned on 9 June 2014 after a critical anomaly, and on 23 November 2015, it reportedly suffered a break-up event.
