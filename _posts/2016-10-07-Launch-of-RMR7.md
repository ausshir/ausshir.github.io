## Rocket Launch Logistics
The day started off with a gathering of all students to discuss the launch. Group A (Numerical Simulation) focused on calculating a trajectory and launch angle by taking the weather into account, as well as giving us some predicted flight statistics. Next, group C (Payload) gave us a status report. As we had tested the day before, all the sensors were working well, and now everything was fully assembled, balanced, and decorated.

The flight was expected to take approximately 90 seconds, and reach an altitude of over 11km. The weather had started to turn sour with dark clouds and heavy rain, but it was still good enough for a launch.

Of course, we still had to name the rocket. As this was a group of  goofy physics nerds, we were more interested in making a good joke than anything else. [Unencumbered](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/17/boaty-mcboatface-wins-poll-to-name-polar-research-vessel) by [common sense](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36225652), we chose the name Rockety McRocketface by a narrow margin. Other great options were [ICI-7](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/ici/) to tease the Universtiy of Oslo's upcoming project, or [Up-Goer-7](https://xkcd.com/1133/) fro, the webcomic XKCD.

## The Launch
We started the launch procedures by running through the countdown. We were using the official Andoya process, which is approximately the same as the one NASA uses (NASA launches research rockets at ASC as well http://andoyaspace.no/?p=2099)
