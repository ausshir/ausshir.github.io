## Off to CaNoRock
For the a week between September 30 and October 8, 2016 I am attending an a student
collaboration between Canada and Norway to build and test a research sounding rocket.
All you need to know is in the name!

The event takes place at the Andoya Space Center in Andennes, Norway. This is a
rocket range which also takes part in High Altitude Balloon experiments and other
space-based research. No doubt this will be an intense week, but my goal is to
keep the entire project documented, with a bit of focus on the interesting details
along the way.

### Programming Your Travel
This time around I do not need to take care of all the booking details, but the
nature of the trip leaves tiny bursts of free time interspersed between intense
projects. To make the most of my time I thought I'd try out the new Google Trips
app, which just made it's official transition from Inbox to a standalone tool and
[seems to be targeted directly at me](https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2016/09/see-more-plan-less-try-google-trips.html)!

A very useful feature of Google Trips is the ability for it to scan metadata or
schemas from your reservation emails. There is a vaguely standard format for This
metadata but Google claims it should just work (and it has for me in the past).

Unfortunately, I haven't made any personal bookings for this trip and had no emails
for it to scan! Furthermore, Google decided users didn't need the feature to manually
input trip bookings. Thankfully there's a [terribly complicated hack](http://www.scottgreenstone.com/2016/03/manuallycreatetrips.html) from Scott Greenstone!

One of my flight bookings looked like this:

    function manuallyCreateTrips() {
      var htmlBody = HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('flight').getContent();

      MailApp.sendEmail({
        to: Session.getActiveUser().getEmail(),
        subject: 'Flight Confirmation - Tromso 2' + new Date(),
        htmlBody: htmlBody,
      });
    }

    <html>
      <body>
        <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      "@context": "http://schema.org",
      "@type": "FlightReservation",
      "reservationNumber": "11",
      "reservationStatus": "http://schema.org/Confirmed",
      "underName": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Austin"
          },
      "reservationFor": {
        "@type": "Flight",
        "flightNumber": "4431",
        "airline": {
          "@type": "Airline",
          "name": "Scandinavian",
          "iataCode": "SAS"
        },
        "departureAirport": {
          "@type": "Airport",
          "name": "Troms√∏ Langnes Arpt",
          "iataCode": "TOS"
        },
        "departureTime": "2016-10-07T18:40:00+02:00",
        "arrivalAirport": {
          "@type": "Airport",
          "name": "Oslo Arpt",
          "iataCode": "OSL"
        },
        "arrivalTime": "2016-10-07T20:35:00+02:00"
      }
    }

*Was it worth it? Apart from the offline trip guides, probably not.. ;)*

### To the skies!
Despite a two hour delay due to A/C issues in the overseas Calgary-London flight, all
connections seemd to meet up and I arrived in Oslo just in time! There were some lovely
and interesting views from some of the flights, and there's even more to come. The Scaninavian
Airlines pilots sure aren't afraid to pull serious G's on takeoff!

### Oslo Mystery Museum

A very uneventful customs desk and a train to the city closed for maintenance, we thought we'd be confined to our rooms for the remainder of the night. It turns out, the hotel was right next to some sort of military museum with some very interesting displays. Unfortunately, it was much too dark to take pictures without my Nokia 930 (all the more fitting in Scandavia). No rockets yet but
I think we're getting close!

Upon further research, the museum was the [Ullensaker Museum](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullensaker_museum), located on one of Norway's oldest Drill grounds, Little Square, and was built in 1740 - reopened as a museum in 2005. There is very little English information on this building so it would be great to check it out again in the light of day!

Up again early next day to catch the express train to town before flying out again!
