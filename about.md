**Robobits** is a simple blog for me to share my technical and personal writing.

My name is Austin Shirley. I am a senior engineering student at the [University of Saskatchewan](http://www.usask.ca/) studying Computer Engineering. I am also very heavily involved as the President of the [University of Saskatchewan Space Design Team](http://usst.ca) or USST.

The USST is a group of students from across campus who come together to build space projects, compete in international challenges and increase the accessibility of STEM projects to the general public. Our current project is a Mars Rover prototype, which recently won the top award at the 2015 [European Rover Challenge](http://roverchallenge.eu/) in Kielce, Poland. Beyond that we build many other recurring projects such as our High Altitude Balloon with the [Saskatoon Amateur Radio Club](http://ve5aa.dyndns.org/), and paticipate in local design challenges and initiatives.

If you would like to learn more about the team, please visit us at http://usst.ca, and check out our[U of S Space Design Team GitHub](https://github.com/UofSSpaceDesignTeam/) where we keep almost all of our projects free and open source. Most blog posts that I write will be posted here too.


Another major project is my Senior Design Project - Telltale HRV. We are just getting started and do not have a lot of news, but we hope to build an open device to change the coruse of research into animal stress and wellbeing in large-scale farming.
