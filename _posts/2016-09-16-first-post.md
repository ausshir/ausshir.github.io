    Hello World!

Oh hey, it worked!

Welcome to my project blog. Like many, it will probably fade into disrepair - but eventually, I will write some funny little updates. I am working on a bunch of great stuff that Iâ€™d like to share! :)

This blog is made with the shiniest new technology. Jekyll and GitHub Pages make up the backend, and the frontend started its life as a lovely theme called Thinkspace.

Happy reading!
