> Hello World!

_Oh hey it worked!_

Welcome to my project blog. Like many, it will probably fade into disrepair - but eventually I will write some funny little updates. I am working on a bunch of great stuff that I'd like to share! :)

This blog is made with the shiniest new technology. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages make up the backend, and the frontend is a lovely theme called [Thinkspace](https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace).

Happy reading!
