## The Andøya Space Center and NAROM
The ASC was started off in 1962 with the Ferdinand I rocket, placing Norway 4th among countries to reach space. Today over 1200 rockets
have been launched ranging from subspace (below 100km) to well over 1500km. Due to its position, the ASC is very well suited to Aurora
research and a large amount of other equipment is present to study these phenomena such as balloons and LIDAR arrays. Nearby, the Andøya
Test Center carries out military launches including the development of the innovative Naval Strike Missle and some drones.

NAROM is an organisation that was formed to promote Norwegian space research but has expanded its scope to work with other Nordic countries,
the ESA and Canada. They are our most important hosts for this week.

## The Rocket Program
This is what we have all been waiting for! The rocket program for this week will use a [CRV-7 Motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRV7) from
Canada which will give it a 2.34-second burn and reach 9km. Atop this is the custom CaNoRock payload inside a steel and aluminium shell which
includes 2.28GHz communications and a large selection of sensors. We will be both launching this rocket and tracking it with a mobile antenna to read live telemetry and eventually form a final report on the launch data.

To complete this project we split into five groups:
- Mechanical Rocket System
- Instrumentation
- Assembly and Testing
- Telemetry and Radios
- Physics and Science

I found myself in the 4th group and will be working on the rocket communication system and tracking during the launch!

## Remote Sensing and Rocket Physics
We also received a few lectures on space technology as a large group, covering the applications and capabilities of modern remote sensing technologies - especially in earth sciences such as geology and climate research. A few examples were given on how infrared sensing can be used to determine the mineral composition of the terrain, as well as vegetation and ocean health. A few of these ideas may make their way
to the USST balloon launch in the future - we are already planning on placing some IR vegetation sensors on our upcoming launch.

A short lecture on Aurora and CME (*Coronal Mass Ejections*) was presented as well, where we learned about the history of Aurora research
and our capabilities to measure it both from the ground and from space. Unknown to me, GPS satellites play a large role in measuring this, 
as their sensor and communications systems are capable of measuring the Total Electron Content of the atmosphere.

Our intro to rocket physics lecture covered a few design considerations for the CaNoRock rocket. Basic nozzle and nosecone shape, weight distribution
and aerodynamics came together to form a basic idea of how the rocket should behave on launch. Especially interesting was the behaviour of the rocket
when it passes and exceeds the sound barrier and how to optimise it for extreme supersonic velocities (Mach 5 and above). To cap it off we built
some very simple paper rockets to demonstrate how to ensure stability in a rocket design. My Up-Goer-VI performed well, but didn't come close to the best launch from the University
of Alberta!

## Social and Bed
In the evening we met to chat for quite a few hours of Norwegian culture, travel to Mars and Nanobots over beers and snacks. A natural conversation for a large group of space nerds from around the world. :)
