## Spaceship Aurora
AS mentioned before, [NAROM](http://andoyaspace.no/?page_id=250) at the Andøya Space Center is focused on education and outreach for the Norwegian space programs. One of their major initiatives is a simulated manned mission called [Spaceship Aurora](http://www.spaceshipaurora.no/en) which is intended to teach school children the details of launching and supporting a real space mission.

The truly inspiring part of this program is it does not just emphasize the glory of the mission crew aborad the spacecraft. Instead it puts a huge spotlight on both the *scientists, mission planning and safety officers* involved on the ground before, during, and after the mission.

Even as a University student, I found the simulation to be exciting and fun - I can't imagine how awsome this would be for grade 8-10! NAROM is also working on brining the ground control simulation direct to classrooms with lesson plans and classroom setups, as well as live connections to Spaceship Aurora to run the mission right in Norwegian classroms. Talk about access to education!

## Balloons
Jose Miguel Gonzalez Perez presented the various balloon technologies in use in Aurora research. As a [big fan](http://ve5aa.usask.ca/Balloon/balloon.html) of balloon launches myself I was already pretty familiar with the major advantages of balloons over rockets. Certainly, if balloons could go as high, there would be no need for these enormously complex sounding rockets! There's no real limit to the payload size of a balloon, and with certain types of materials the balloon can last days or even weeks at a stable altitude.

Stay tuned for the next USST balloon launch this October. We hope to launch a number of interesting sensors such as a geiger counter for atmospheric ionization and a new IR camera for vegetation analysis.

## Group - TM Station
CaNoRock students were split up into their various groups - we spent the time learning about the parts of the student Telemetry (TM) Station. The rockets are using a 2.2GHz FM signal with Bi-Phase PCM. This is a geat choice because of how simple and easy to explain it using physical devices like amplifiers, combiners, and demodulators. Yet at the same time it is very robust and allows for a lot of error. Althouh we will not be using this TM station for the main launch, it will be useful at the beginning because the size and shape of the antenna can be gimbaled a lot faster to keep up with the rocket at the start of its flight.

# ASC Tour
The NAROM instructors split the CaNoRock students into two groups for a tour of the facility. One major surprise to me is the modernity of everything - a lot of similar rocket launch facilities are very simple with older technology becayse it has been tried an proven. The ASC has been really good at keeing its systems upgraded and cutting edge, and combined with the ALOMAR Lidar station and other scientific facilities nearby, a lot of special services can be offered that aren't available at other launch sites in the US - which is why NASA also uses Andøya for sounding rockets.

Another baffling concept to me was the lack of security. A key card is needed to get everywhere, and cameras track your every h but it grants access to mostly all facilities. That really underlies the lack of crime in Norway.. but being on an isolated island at 69 degrees North helps a bit too!

## FOOD
Wow, great food today, especially the Waffles. Must get pictures!!

## World Space Week
CanNoRock XIII is the northernmost part of [World Space Week](http://www.worldspaceweek.org/). Check out all the other cool events!
