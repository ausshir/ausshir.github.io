## A Morning in Oslo
The trains were running bright and early! In fact, they were running exactly on time meaning we'd missed our intended one by a few seconds. Thankfully, the sevice happens every 20 minutes on Sunday mornings and every 10 minutes in the afternoon.

This train station had a very interetsing spot with a directional speaker that would whisper poetry to you. I haven't been able to figure out any details on this but I will be sure to ask one of the Oslo University students about it. *Update: I have been told that it is just an art installation and not a normal part of a train station.*

Once in Oslo we walked around the downtown loosely according to one of my Google Trips tours. We were determined to see the [Vigeland Installation, also "Frognerparken"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogner_Park) at the historical Frogner Manor for their famous permanent sculpture installation created by Gustav Vigeland. This was planned and erected from the 1920's to 1930's and includes dozens of statues of people engaging in activivies like wrestling, hugging, stretching, and of course fighting off a mob of babies!

## Tromsø and Andøya
Taking off from the Oslo Airport, the weather turned a bit sour and you could not see much of the ground. I was lucky to catch a glimpse as the terrain turned from Boreal forests to Tundra! Upon landing I was shuttled to inreasingly smaller aircraft and airports until arriving at the Space Center where we did a small tour, chatted with students from the University of Tromsø and Oslo. Time for bed for an early breakfast!
