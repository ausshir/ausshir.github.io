## ALOMAR Observatory
First thing in the morning we travelled to ALOMAR - the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research. This facility uses Laser light to measure the atmosphere at any height from the ground to the thermosphere. There are countless uses for this equipment, from detecting the thickness of the ozone layer or other gas layers, [planetary gravity waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SqMCIKV364) and much more. They also have a wide range of lasers to use in conjunction with nearby research Radar stations and the Andoya Space Center carry out extremely comprehensive experiments.
