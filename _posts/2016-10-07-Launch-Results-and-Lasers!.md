## ALOMAR Observatory
First thing in the morning we travelled to ALOMAR - the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research. This facility uses Laser light to measure the atmosphere at any height from the ground to the thermosphere. There are countless uses for this equipment, such as detecting the thickness of the ozone layer or other gas layers, [planetary gravity waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SqMCIKV364), and much more. They also have quite the selection of lasers to use in conjunction with nearby research Radar stations and the Andoya Space Center carry out amazingly extensive coordinated experiments.

You certainly can't complain about the view either. I can imagine that it is quite the ordeal to get to the top of the mountain in the middle of the winter to take advantage of the 24 hours of darkness.

## Presentations
Each student group briefly presented their analysis on the rocket data recorded the previous day. I won't go into detail here but instead, point out some highlights I found particularly interesting.

### Rocket Physics
One of the groups launched a balloon radiosonde to gather local weather data, especially wind at altitude. They were able to determine the location of the tropopause (constant temperature in the troposphere), as well as the altitude of cloud layers.

They also did some numerical simulations to calculate air velocity, pressure and temperature. These results were interesting to my group, as we were unsure if the rocket's speed skewed the air pressure meter. In fact, it appears that the shock cone around the nose stabilised the air pressure near the rocket.

### Acceleration into Speed
Another group took the accelerometer and used it to calculate the speed. This measurement had many interesting caveats which made it challenging. Firstly, the accelerometer only measured force in the direction of the rocket and radially; secondly, the rocket travels in an arc and changes orientation; thirdly, the rocket is spiralling madly; and finally, the accelerometer measured from the ground reference frame and not the vehicle.

To figure out the speed, a significant amount of math and frame of reference translations are needed with many, many assumptions, but in the end, they confirmed their results to a simulated rocket with surprising accuracy!

### Balancing the Rocket
The basic payload design was very simple - an aluminium tube with a steel nose. However, once you put electronics inside things can get messy. The payload team did a good job with cable management and layout, but you can never be too sure when going Mach 5. The team place the rocket on rollers to ensure that everything is balanced inside, the team put the rocket on rollers and made sure that it spun freely. Once it did not settle in a particular orientation, they knew it was relatively balanced.

## Vi Snakkes!
With the end of the final presentations and an exchange of many stickers, we eventually had to load onto a bus back to Andenes. In Tromso, we parted ways with the UiT students with many hugs and later parted with the UiO students in Oslo after making grand plans to meet up again and launch rockets in Iceland - halfway between Norway and Canada. I suppose only time will tell!
